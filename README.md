A simple Mininet network with four docker containers, two switches, and two remote controllers.
Mininet Simple Network
This Python script creates a simple network using Mininet. The network consists of two docker containers, two switches, and two controllers. The docker containers are assigned the IP addresses 10.0.2.10 and 10.0.2.20, and the switches are assigned the IP addresses 192.168.2.30 and 192.168.2.40. The network is started using the net.start() function, and a CLI is launched to interact with the network.

To run the script, you will need to have Mininet installed. You can install Mininet using the following command:

pip install mininet


Once Mininet is installed, you can run the script by typing the following command in a terminal:

python mininet_simple_network.py

The script will create the network and start the CLI. You can then interact with the network using the CLI.
